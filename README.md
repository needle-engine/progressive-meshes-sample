# Progressive Meshes, Textures and automatic LOD generation

This repository contains examples for progressive mesh and texture loading and automatic LOD generation

Key features:
- **Reduced download size** for faster loading of your website.
- **Improved performance** for rendering, physics and raycasting.
- Load highpoly meshes and we make it run smoothly!

The repository contains two example setups. One uses Unity and the other one just uses vite and doesn't require any editor.

## 1) Vite

The vite project is setup to run locally or build and deploy to glitch using node.

1) Go to `./Progressive Meshes Vite Sample`
2) Run `npm i && npm start`
3) See [README](./Progressive%20Meshes%20Vite%20Sample/README.md) for more details



## 2) Unity

The project uses Unity 2021.3 and Needle Engine 4.12.3.

- **[Live Version](https://progressive-meshes-zubcksxqvae.needle.run/)**
