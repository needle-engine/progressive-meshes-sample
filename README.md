# Progressive Meshes and automatic LOD generation

This repository contains examples for progressive mesh loading and automatic LOD generation - a new feature in Needle Engine >= 3.36

Key features:
- **Reduced download size** for faster loading of your website.
- **Improved performance** for rendering, physics and raycasting.
- Load highpoly meshes and we make it run smoothly!

The repository contains two example setups. One uses Unity and the other one just uses vite and doesn't require any editor.

## 1) Vite

The vite project is setup to run locally or build and deploy to glitch using node.

1) Go to `./Progressive Meshes Vite Sample`
2) Run `npm i && npm start`
3) See [README](./Progressive%20Meshes%20Vite%20Sample/README.md) for more details



## 2) Unity

The project uses Unity 2021.3 and Needle Engine 3.36 Beta.

- **[Live Version](https://engine.needle.tools/demos/lods/)** / [Alternative Version with Postprocessing](https://engine.needle.tools/demos/lod-postprocessing/)
- [Code](./Progressive%20Meshes%20Unity%20Sample/Needle%20Web%20Project/src/modelswitch.ts)

### How to use

1) Open the Unity project and the "Scene"
2) Click Play
3) After export and compression the local server opens in the browser
